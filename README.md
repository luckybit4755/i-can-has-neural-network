spot to develop understanding of neural networks 

# approaches

I'm coming at this from a few different directions. This allows the ideas to sink in and keeps me from getting too bored with one way of learning.

## from scratch

This is all about writing small neural networks with simple mathematic principles and building from there to hopefully get an understanding of something closer to the state of the art

## ml5 via coding train

This is a lot more hands-on using trained model and is more application focused. It tends to be a lot more fun in a conventional sense and the sort of things you can show your friends and maybe they will say "that's sort of neat"
