			<ul>
				<li>hidden: defines the number and size of the hidden layers, should be in the format: [n]; where n is 1 or more integers</li>
				<li>mechanism: defines the survival criteria</li>
				<li>size: size of the board, probably just leave it alone</li>
				<li>count: number of nubs in each generation</li>
				<li>generation: how many turns does each generation live</li>
				<li>perFrame: controls how fast the simulation runs vs the display, higher is faster</li>

				<li>maxGenerations: maximum number of generation before halting the simulatinon</li>

		<h2>wat in the wat?</h2>
		<p>
			A fair question!
		</p>
		<p>
			What's going on here? The short answer is the real-time evolution of primitive brains in your browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each "nub" in the population has a neural network in the classic full mesh configuration with some quirks.
			Each node in all the layers (including the input and output layers) have recurrent bit to potentially keep part of their last state:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img src="images/wnn.png" width="40%"/>
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's how the simuation works:
			<ol>
				<li>every weight in each nub's brain is given a random value</li>
				<li>a number of iterations are run (see below) until the generation is over</li>
				<li>a fitness criteria is used to pick survivers, typically being in a "safe" area of the screen</li>
				<li>the survivers are used to create the next generation of nubs (see below)</li>
				<li>the process continues until either the maximum number of generations or survival percentage is achieved</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Each iterations proceeds as follows:
			<ol>
				<li>each nub's input layer is set based on conditions in the environment (see below)</li>
				<li>forward propagation occurse by performing matrix multiplication throughout the layers</li>
				<li>the output layer decides which of the 8 compass directions to move</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Each generations is created from the "survivors" from the previous generation like so:
			<ol>
				<li>each generation has the same <b>count</b> of nubs</li>
				<li>for each new nub, 2 random parents are picked</li>
				<li>the new nub's values for every weight, bias, layer and setting is determined by:
					<ol>
						<li>random value (based on mutation chance)</li>
						<li>50% parent A value</li>
						<li>50% parent B value</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			The hope is that the survivors will pass on
			the mental characteristics to their offspring
			allowing them a better shot at survival
		</p>

		<h2>Is this real?</h2>
		<p>
			As crazy as it may seem this little demo is small
			evolutionary model based on randomly initialized
			neural networks which struggle and adapt their
			behaviour for survival.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may see flocking behavior like birds,
			jumping like insects or crawling like worms!
		</p>
		<p>
			Is it cruel? It feels that way a bit... even
			if they are simple virtual creatures, they seem
			to be alive in some sense so killing them feels
			wrong even if it does mirror nature. As a result,
			the simulation keeps going after the threshold
			with a sort of nub Valhalla where they can frolic
			as long as you let them live in your browser!

			That said... often the long run dispotion of
			nubs tends to become banal... So maybe death is
			necessary after all... â˜
